# Choice-of-Pokemon

In this project you can see an exhibition of 4 3D models based on Pokèmon.
The first thing we see are three Pokeballs, referring to the beginning of all Pokèmon games where you had to choose your first Pokèmon among 3 different options. Depending on which key you click you will see the model of the three Pokèmon
in a more detailed way of the three Pokèmon we have chosen, to make your final choice easier.
We also wanted to set the skyboxes with a colour according to the main type of the Pokèmon, we decided to use simple skyboxes as they looked much better.

CONTROLS:
	
	Key 0 -> Model of the Pokeballs
	Key 1 -> Pokèmon number 1 (POLIWAG)
	Key 2 -> Pokémon number 2 (TOGEPI)
	Key 3 -> Pokèmon number 3 (GEODUDE)

BUTTONS: 
In the upper left corner, there are two buttons, their functions are as follows:

	Button "Freeze me!  -> Stops the rotations and centers you the model to a front view.
	Button "Unfreeze me!  -> Resumes the rotation.

Once in exposure mode you can rotate and change the direction of rotation of the model by pressing:
	
	Key "A" -> Rotate to the left, holding down increases the rotation rate.
	Key "D" -> Rotate to the right, holding down increases the rotation rate.
	Mouse -> To rotate freely at the speed desired by the user.
